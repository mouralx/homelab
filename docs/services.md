# Services

All services are defined in [services/compose.yaml](../services/compose.yaml).

All services run together on Beelink in the `lab` Compose project.

## Fixed container addresses

The `homelab_static` bridge uses subnet `10.203.0.0/24`. Service-to-service calls can use these addresses or the Compose service names:

| Service | Container IP |
| --- | --- |
| `openclaw` | `10.203.0.10` |
| `npm` | `10.203.0.12` |
| `n8n` | `10.203.0.20` |
| `transmission` | `10.203.0.21` |
| `jellyfin` | `10.203.0.22` |
| `portainer` | `10.203.0.23` |
| `homeassistant` | `10.203.0.25` |

Make sure `10.203.0.0/24` is unused on Beelink's LAN, VPN, and Docker networks before deployment. Home Assistant is on the bridge to receive a fixed address; automatic mDNS/broadcast discovery may be limited. Its web interface remains published on host port `8123`.

## AI services

### `openclaw`

- Image: `ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:latest`
- Purpose: AI agent gateway and Control UI
- Port: `18789`
- Persistent configuration and workspace: `~/openclaw`; auth-profile secrets: `~/openclaw/auth-profile-secrets`.
- Optional `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` overrides the token saved during onboarding. For GitHub deployments, store it as an environment secret.
- The gateway uses `--allow-unconfigured` to bypass the missing-config startup guard during bootstrap. This does not create configuration or configure a model provider. Set `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` before starting an unconfigured gateway, since LAN binding requires authentication.

Before first startup, create both host directories and make them writable by the image's `node` user (UID/GID `1000:1000`; account for UID mapping when using rootless Docker). From the repository root, complete onboarding with your model provider credentials:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f services/compose.yaml run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint node openclaw dist/index.js onboard --mode local --no-install-daemon
```

Configure `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` in `~/openclaw/openclaw.json` for the exact HTTPS origin used to access the dashboard through Nginx Proxy Manager. Then start the stack. See the [official Docker setup documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install/docker) for pairing and configuration details.

## Home services

### `homeassistant`
- Image: `ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable`
- Purpose: home automation and device management
- Uses bridge networking with fixed container address `10.203.0.25`, exposed on host port `8123`. Automatic mDNS/broadcast discovery may be limited; add integrations manually or configure a discovery relay.

### `transmission`
- Image: `lscr.io/linuxserver/transmission:latest`
- Purpose: torrent client
- Exposed on ports `9091`, `51413/tcp`, `51413/udp`

### `jellyfin`
- Image: `lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest`
- Purpose: media playback
- Exposed on port `8096`

## Platform services

### `npm`
- Image: `jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest`
- Purpose: reverse proxy and HTTPS termination
- Host ports: `8088` (HTTP), `8448` (HTTPS), and `8181` (admin UI, container port `81`). Open the admin UI at `http://<beelink-lan-address>:8181`.

### `portainer`

- Image: `portainer/portainer-ce:latest`
- Published ports: `9000/tcp`, `9443/tcp`

Nginx Proxy Manager publishes host ports `8088/tcp` (container `80`), `8181/tcp` (container `81`), and `8448/tcp` (container `443`). Jellyfin also publishes discovery on `7359/udp`. Transmission's TCP/UDP peer port follows `TRANSMISSION_PEER_PORT` (default `51413`).

### `n8n`

- Image: `n8nio/n8n:latest`
- Keep `~/n8n/data` mounted: it holds the default SQLite database, encryption key, and other instance settings.
- Published port: `5678`.

## Database storage

Nginx Proxy Manager, n8n, Home Assistant Recorder, and Jellyfin use their default SQLite databases. OpenClaw retains its local storage, Portainer uses BoltDB, and Transmission uses configuration and torrent state files. No external database service is deployed.
